# Why is there no arrow system yet.
I'm not quite good with rhythm game systems in general so i've been looking for devs to help deal with those. If you are a Godot Game Developer and understand these types of systems please contact me at: linuxmaster 2.0#6062
# DEVELOPMENT NOTE:
I'm now attempting to create the arrow system myself, tho I'm really pressured from the other fnf godot remakes (they are not as advanced as mine yet) that might overtake this engine so I'm going to be working on the engine on full overdrive now, let's hope i can keep up.
