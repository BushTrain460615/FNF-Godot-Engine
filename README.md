# FNF-Godot-Engine
Hello, Welcome to my repo of my Friday Night Funkin' Remake in the Godot Engine.
# Building
to Build the game just open the project.godot file in your favourite Godot 3.4+ Editor and Hit Export then select your desired platform.
# TF is a WFC
Funkin' WFC is part of the WFC Online Network Service. Funkin' WFC provides Downloading of Mods via the internet inside the Game, Chatrooms, Mutiplayer Online Sessions, forums, and much much more.
# Any DOCS for the Rhythm System Yet.
Nope not yet but me and my friend HypnoDev are working on writing DOCS for the rhythm system and how to use it.
They will be in extreme detail and will teach some godot basics as well
