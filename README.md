# Building
to Build the game just open the project.godot file in your favourite Godot 3.4+ Editor and Hit Export then select your desired platform.
# TF is a WFC
Funkin' WFC is part of the WFC Online Network Service. Funkin' WFC provides Downloading of Mods via the internet inside the Game, Chatrooms, Mutiplayer Online Sessions, forums, and much much more.

WFC Is in development and will probs be out by version 2.0.
# Any DOCS for the Rhythm System Yet.
Yep, It's in the Docs Folder.
# ModChart Support?
Kinda, we will have two versions of the engine.
One will be without ModChart Support and can be opened in any Godot Editor.
Another will have ModChart Support But will require you to build the Godot engine with a Lua
Module (we will provide the source you just need to compile it)
