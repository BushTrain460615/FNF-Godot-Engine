# FNF-Godot-Engine
Hello, Welcome to my repo of my Friday Night Funkin' Remake in the Godot Engine.
# Building
to Build the game just open the project.godot file in your favourite godot editor and Hit Export then select your desired platform. (We might plan on android support but we'll see).
# TF is a WFC
Funkin' WFC is part of the WFC Online Network Service. Funkin' WFC provides Downloading of Mods via the internet inside the Game, Chatrooms, Mutiplayer Online Sessions, forums, and much much more.
# Why is there no arrow system yet.
I'm not quite good with rhythm game systems in general so i've been looking for devs to help deal with those. If you are a Godot Game Developer and understand these types of systems please contact me at: linuxmaster 2.0#6062
